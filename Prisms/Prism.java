/* Write this abstract class called Prism.  It has one private field (height) and a constructor.  
 * It contains the methods calcAreaOfBase, calcPerimeter, calcVolume, and calcSA.
 * None of these methods require parameters.   
 * A couple are abstract - can you tell which ones and why?
 * 
 * Math note:
 * The volume of any prism can be found by multiplying the area of the base by the height.
 * The surface area of any prism can be found by multiplying the perimeter of the base by the height
 *   and then adding on the areas of the 2 bases.
